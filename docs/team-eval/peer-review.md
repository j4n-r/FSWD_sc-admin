## Jan Rueggeberg - review for Selin Günaydin 

I know learning programming is hard, and it's completely fine if it's not everyone's passion - I'm willing to write the application myself. I think I did everything I could to help you contribute to the project. Besides, it's not my responsibility to teach you the things we did in the class.
I would have liked to have better communication about pain points and plans on your end. But since you had some personal issues, I can overlook that.
