## Selin G端naydin - review for Jan Rueggeberg

I acknowledge that Jan contributed significantly more in terms of development work. While I focused on project organization, evaluation, and documentation, I could have been more involved in the technical side and asked for help earlier when I was unsure. For future projects, I want to become more confident in technical discussions and actively take on more implementation tasks to better balance the workload.


## Jan Rueggeberg - review for Selin G端naydin 

I know learning programming is hard, and it's completely fine if it's not everyone's passion. I think I did everything I could to help you contribute to the project, like having a video call to introduce you to the project and giving you examplerary tasks. Besides that, it's not my responsibility to teach you the things we did in the class.
I would have liked to have better communication about pain points and plans on your end. But since you had some personal issues, I can overlook that.
