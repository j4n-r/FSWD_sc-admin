## Communication  
- Set up **regular short check-ins** (e.g., weekly stand-ups) to track progress and align priorities  
- Define responsibilities and task ownership **earlier in the process**  

---

## Project Planning  
- Create a **detailed project timeline** with milestones from the beginning  
- Assign **intermediate deadlines** to sub-tasks to prevent end-phase stress  

---

## Development Process  
- Assign clear roles
- Agree on the tech stack early

---

## Documentation & Testing  
- Begin writing **user and developer documentation early**, as the system grows  
- Schedule **usability tests at multiple points**, not only at the end  
- Record **decisions and reasons in real-time** in the documentation (Design Decisions or Changelog)
