### Goal

We aimed to evaluate the usability and effectiveness of the user and group management features from an admin perspective.  
**Main research question:**  
“How easily can professors create, edit, and delete student groups and users in the current system?”

### Method

We conducted a usability test
Each participant was asked to:
- Create a new account
- Delete and edit an existing group and user

### Results

- **Success rate:** 100% completed all tasks  
- **Average time:** 1-2 min  


### Implications

This evaluation confirmed that the core functionality works reliably. 

- Add a confirmation dialog when deleting a group
